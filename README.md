#My Learning Journey

The biggest challenge I faced was validating user input — especially phone numbers and email addresses.
At first, users could enter invalid emails (like uppercase or missing @) or short numbers, causing errors later.

I solved this by learning and implementing regular expressions (regex) to validate both:

-Phone numbers must start with 6–9 and be 10 digits long.

-Emails must contain only lowercase letters and follow a format like example@gmail.com.

Through this, I learned the importance of data validation and error handling in user-facing programs.
